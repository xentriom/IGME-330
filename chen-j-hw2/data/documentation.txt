Two audio effect nodes added:
- Bass (frequency and gain)
- Treble (frequency and gain)

Sprite class:
located in spirte.js, it basically is responsible for the spinning of image
the 3 balls that appear in the canvas is what your most likely looking for
their size scales on audio (you should notice them getting bigger/smaller)
it is likely going to only be visible on the red one since the others have such small scale

App data:
- Title
- draw parameters
- audio file data

Aesthics:
I would say im more backend when it comes to web stuff, i like the javascript.
I can never seem to get the correct layout i want so im going to insert a picture
with what i was trying to accomplish. I think i deserve the full 15% since i tried
to implement the aesthics i wanted to go for but failed, miserably.
one thing i hate is the two balls, my creative mind went blank as i implemented 
them so now theyre just bouncing around. also i think the 60fps limit is making me want to puke....
